# OpenLP-Song-Usage-Tracker
A simple python script to find and list the last date of use for songs in OpenLP

Some notes for anyone looking to play.
The filenames are hardcoded for simplicity so unless the worlds wierdest coincidence happens you'll need to change that
Song usage tracking must be turned on obviously but it's worth a mention
This program isn't intended to be seen I have it set to run on a schedule once a week and not be heard from so not much is needed or put to use so understand that going in.
This is written in Python 2.7 but can easily be converted for Python 3
I intend to make improvements in the future but for now it is fully functional and complete so enjoy.
